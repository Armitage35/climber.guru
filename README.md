Climber Guru is an app for climbers who want to get more out of their training through more data.

## Key features

Climber Guru lets you save your climbs and answer some of the questions we climbers would like to answer but don't have the tools to:

- How am I progressing? Did I just reach a plateau?
- Have my latest sessions been bad, good or awesome?
- Where should I expect to be in a few month?
- What should I be looking to train more?
- What grade do I onsight?
- Is it time for me to try another grade?
- How much closer to onsighting this grade am I?
- And obviously: how much better than my friends am I?

I will also provide you with the means to bring your climbing book over from your shelf and in a place you are actually able to get to when you need to.
